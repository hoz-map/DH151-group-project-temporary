		<h2>What does this map show?</h2>
		<p> This map shows the amount of plastic waste that are mismanaged in each country. Hover over a country to see the amount of mismanaged plastic waste.</p>

		<h2>Why does mismanaged plastic waste matter?</h2> 
		<p>Plastics contain toxic chemicals, which are phthalates, poly-fluorinated chemicals, bisphenol A (BPA), brominated flame retardants, and antimony trioxide. 
			Therefore, mismanaged plastic waste can pollute the environment. 
			The pollutions in water and air increase the risk of health issues, such as cardiovascular diseases, neurobehavioral disorders, and reproductive health issues.
			This is why it is important to raise awareness towards mismanaged plastic waste in the world. (<a href="https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijtra/international-journal-of-toxicology-and-risk-assessment-ijtra-5-021.php?jid=ijtra"> Alabi et.al., 2019</a>) </p>
