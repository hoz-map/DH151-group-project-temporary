# Overview: 
Our project aims to understand the way wastes generated by the global north travels through a global network and how this system disproportionately affects the health of people living in the global south. Imported waste and recycling is not only deleterious to the environment of the countries that manage it, but can also be harmful to the health of individuals. 
Through understanding where wastes originate, where it goes to be processed, and the global communities involved, we hope to better understand how exposure to waste-management operations is correlated with the health of these communities. 

# Methodology: 
Web mapping can offer a layer of narrative to better understand the global, sociopolitical, and individual factors that are at play with any modern issue. In the context of global waste networks, mapping as a methodology of inquiry can help connect the seemingly-disparate players involved and affected. 
Mapping will allow us to produce a narrative of how waste travels in global networks and affects peoples who often are not the main producers of such waste. It will also help visualize the magnitude and difference of waste generated by each stakeholder.

# Technical scope: 
We will be using *Leaflet* to visualize our maps. *Git* and *Visual Studio Code Live Share* will be used to collaborate and coordinate code between members. The languages/tools we'll be using for our website will be Javascript, HTML, and CSS. A combination of Excel, Google Sheets, and Google Sheets plugin will help us manage and geocode the datasets that we'll be using. 


# Data: 
**Set 1: DH151_Waste Generation**

URL: (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TKgcbI5DOFvSAqtAb1f6eDQ3MtZJR6lwde7G3_o5WJY/edit?usp=sharing) 

This data has been downloaded and geocoded with a GoogleSheets plugin. It breaks down the various types of waste generated by each country, how much waste is generated, and how much waste is properly processed or littered. This may also be a layer that can be turned on/off and can be implemented in our maps that show a more global distribution of waste practices.

**Set 2: Indicator 11.6.1: Municipal Solid Waste collection coverage by cities (percent)**

URL: https://unstats-undesa.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/indicator-11-6-1-municipal-solid-waste-collection-coverage-by-cities-percent 

This data includes information about the percentage of municipal waste being collected and managed in controlled facilities, out of the entire waste generated in each city. This data will be downloaded from the UN SDG indicators page, and data from 2015 and 2017 (2016 is not included in the dataset) will be visualized on the map. The visibility of this data can be toggled.

**Set 3: UN Comtrade Data: 2016 and 2017 China, HK, USA import and export plastic**

URL: https://comtrade.un.org/data/ 

Data on the import and export of plastic wastes will be downloaded from this page; countries involved will be determined at a later date. The countries will be geocoded with a GoogleSheets plugin. Import and export data can be added to separate layers and can be turned on/off to see differences in which countries export versus import plastic wastes.

**Set 4 : China statistical yearbook 2017: Collection, transport, and disposal of consumption wastes in cities by region (2016)**

URL: http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/2017/indexeh.htm 

This data will be downloaded and geocoded with a GoogleSheets plugin. This will then be mapped onto China with pop-ups to visualize the location of each city, as well as the amount of waste it produces in comparison to other cities. This will all be a layer that can be turned on/off, and will offer a more country-specific snapshot of what waste management looks like in China.
