**Hozumi:** Hozumi(she/her) is a fourth-year Sociology major and Global Health/Digital Humanities double minor. She is interested in using digital mapping to address global public health issues.

# Overview: 
Our project aims to understand the way wastes generated by the global north travels through a global network and how this system disproportionately affects the health of people living in the global south. Imported waste and recycling is not only deleterious to the environment of the countries that manage it, but can also be harmful to the health of individuals. 
Through understanding where wastes originate, where it goes to be processed, and the global communities involved, we hope to better understand how exposure to waste-management operations is correlated with the health of these communities. 

# Methodology: 
Web mapping can offer a layer of narrative to better understand the global, sociopolitical, and individual factors that are at play with any modern issue. In the context of global waste networks, mapping as a methodology of inquiry can help connect the seemingly-disparate players involved and affected. 
Mapping will allow us to produce a narrative of how waste travels in global networks and affects peoples who often are not the main producers of such waste. It will also help visualize the magnitude and difference of waste generated by each stakeholder.

# Technical scope: 
We will be using *Leaflet* to visualize our maps. *Git* and *Visual Studio Code Live Share* will be used to collaborate and coordinate code between members. The languages/tools we'll be using for our website will be Javascript, HTML, and CSS. A combination of Excel, Google Sheets, and Google Sheets plugin will help us manage and geocode the datasets that we'll be using. 


# Data: 
**Set 1: DH151_Waste Generation**

URL: (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TKgcbI5DOFvSAqtAb1f6eDQ3MtZJR6lwde7G3_o5WJY/edit?usp=sharing) 

This data has been downloaded and geocoded with a GoogleSheets plugin. It breaks down the various types of waste generated by each country, how much waste is generated, and how much waste is properly processed or littered. This may also be a layer that can be turned on/off and can be implemented in our maps that show a more global distribution of waste practices.

**Set 2: Indicator 11.6.1: Municipal Solid Waste collection coverage by cities (percent)**

URL: https://unstats-undesa.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/indicator-11-6-1-municipal-solid-waste-collection-coverage-by-cities-percent 

This data includes information about the percentage of municipal waste being collected and managed in controlled facilities, out of the entire waste generated in each city. This data will be downloaded from the UN SDG indicators page, and data from 2015 and 2017 (2016 is not included in the dataset) will be visualized on the map. The visibility of this data can be toggled.

**Set 3: UN Comtrade Data: 2016 and 2017 China, HK, USA import and export plastic**

URL: https://comtrade.un.org/data/ 

Data on the import and export of plastic wastes will be downloaded from this page; countries involved will be determined at a later date. The countries will be geocoded with a GoogleSheets plugin. Import and export data can be added to separate layers and can be turned on/off to see differences in which countries export versus import plastic wastes.

**Set 4 : China statistical yearbook 2017: Collection, transport, and disposal of consumption wastes in cities by region (2016)**

URL: http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/2017/indexeh.htm 

This data will be downloaded and geocoded with a GoogleSheets plugin. This will then be mapped onto China with pop-ups to visualize the location of each city, as well as the amount of waste it produces in comparison to other cities. This will all be a layer that can be turned on/off, and will offer a more country-specific snapshot of what waste management looks like in China.

# UX
## Initial Brainstorming

### Mindmaps

</p>

  **Alice’s Notes:** I unintentionally made my mind map very linear. I think our site layout can reflect this by being long in design, which can help promote a sense of story-telling and narrative.
  
  
  **Emily:** The progression actually provides a blueprint for how we may want to structure each topic/page, so I think this mindmap will help a lot when constructing the write-up.
  
  
  **Hozumi:** I like how Alice draws some images with notes, as well as some features to include (e.g. zoom in feature). These provide a clearer vision to create our website.


#### Emily:

</p>
  
  **Emily’s Notes:** n/a; primary concern is time constraints in the face of unexpected errors
  
  
  **Alice:** I like how simple the mind map is. It’s clear what our page should include in terms of content, and I appreciate the map’s practicality in identifying possible issues we should look out for.
  
  
  **Hozumi:** Emily's mind map helps me have a better understanding of how we can structure our page. As Alice mentioned, I also like how she lists the possible issues.

  
#### Hozumi:
<p align="center">
  <img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62718306/116008426-7475c800-a5e2-11eb-92ff-f8e21e923939.png">
</p>
 
 **Hozumi's Notes:** My map is focusing on listing our potential topics in waste management. I hope we can narrow down our focus on the topic.


  **Alice:** I like how Hozumi breaks down our research topic into subcategories of global waste and case studies, as well as general waste and plastic waste. I think this would translate well into the breakdown of our site design.
  
  
  **Emily:** The topic shift from macro to micro is what appeals to me about this mindmap; I also like the transition from a general sketch of ideas to actually thinking about what the final product will look like-- breaking down the brainstorming aspect of it and turning it into a list will help us in the formation of the website's layout.
  
 
### Crazy Eights

</p>
  
  **Alice’s Notes:** I went into this exercise just hoping to get some design elements down on paper. Everything ended up being much more detail-oriented, such as small icon designs and details about arrow heads. That said, I appreciate my team members’ larger-picture ideas; I think all of our designs work together to help create a more cohesive whole.
  
  
  **Emily:** I really enjoy the dive into aesthetics -- the “Rethink Recycling” logo in particular is a nice touch!
  
  
  **Hozumi:** I really appreciate her creativity and think she is a great designer. I have never thought of creating icon buttons that indicate each different section and am very excited for implementing these great ideas on our page.

  
#### Emily:

</p>
  
  **Emily’s Notes:** Messed around with a couple combos for the site’s layout, as well as made a few notes on other features that could be added to the site.
  
  
  **Alice:** I really like the linear design of the page, as well as the extras! I think embedding media such as videos and music can be very helpful for our narrative as well. 
  
  
  **Hozumi:** I really like how Emily considers details of our page, such as the format, music, and color scheme of the page. These details would help us create a better web page!
  
  
  
#### Hozumi:
<p align="center">
  <img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62718306/116008358-206ae380-a5e2-11eb-9fc0-b093929dbcc3.png">
</p>
  
  **Hozumi's Notes:** I was only thinking about the larger picture of the page, so I really appreciate Alice and Emily for the detailed ideas. (Also I was not able to come up with an 8th image, so mine is crazy 7.)
  
  
  **Alice:** I really like how these ideas all are very wire-frame-like. I like the modular design which is still diverse enough at each stage to be engaging. I also like the About Us section that can make our page more personable.
  
  
  **Emily:** Diving into a sample map and taking into account what kind of theme our site might be like is a really nice aspect of these ideas. The bottle icons sketched out here in particular reflect the core themes of our project.
