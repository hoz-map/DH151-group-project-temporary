        <p class="font2">
            The goal of Rethink Recycle is to help users understand the scope of the global waste-management network. While many of us are able to sort our plastic waste and hope that it is in fact recycled and repurposed, the truth is that the recycling process is not so straightforward. The United States only recycles a fraction of its plastic waste and instead exports a large amount of it to countries across the globe. While countries differ in the way they manage their own waste, these practices also all have different effects on both human and environmental health. Therefore, the true impact of plastic waste goes beyond sorting oneâ€™s recycling; Rethink Recycle hopes to make this reality clearer.

        <h2 class="font1"> HOW TO USE</h2>
        <p class = "font2">
            Currently, the Rethink Recycle map shows the global trade of plastic waste that the United States engaged in between the years of 2016 to 2018. 
            <br>
            All layers can be viewed in the top right corner. These layers can be used to compare the magnitude of plastic waste being imported and exported by the United States to the world in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Green represents exporting plastic waste, while red represents importing plastic waste.
            <br>
            As the mouse moves over a circle, a popup will appear that will include the countries involved, the weight of the plastic waste transported, and the year the import/export occurred.
            <br>
            All circle sizes are proportional to the amount of plastic transported. For best viewing results, layers should be isolated for analysis.
